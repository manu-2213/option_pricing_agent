## A. High-Level Architecture

The system is designed as a multi-layered pipeline that integrates Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) using AgentTorch, Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL), and LLM-driven insights. The framework consists of four core components:

Environment Layer (AgentTorch Simulation):

Simulates a dynamic market with multiple heterogeneous agents interacting in a limit order book (LOB) environment.
Generates real-time market data, such as bid-ask spreads, price trends, and trading volumes.

RL Agent Layer:

Implements a Deep Q-Learning Agent (DQN) to optimize the hedging strategy.
Uses the market environment's state as input and outputs hedging decisions.
The reward function focuses on minimizing hedging error (e.g., delta/gamma neutrality) and maximizing profitability.

LLM Augmentation Layer:

Uses a pre-trained LLM (e.g., GPT-4) to process macroeconomic indicators, market sentiment, and volatility trends.
Converts these insights into high-level features to complement the RL agent's decision-making.
Evaluation and Benchmarking Layer:

Compares the performance of:
The RL agent (baseline).
The RL + LLM agent (augmented).
Existing state-of-the-art models



## B. Key Modules and Interactions

1. AgentTorch Simulation Layer

Purpose: Simulate a realistic financial market environment.

Agents:
- Market Makers: Maintain liquidity by placing bids and offers, and setting bid-ask spreads.
- Institutional Investors: Trade large volumes based on macro-level strategies.
- Retail Traders: Simulate noise in the market with random trading patterns.
- RL Agent: Interacts with the environment to perform hedging actions.

Outputs: Market features such as:
- Limit order book (LOB) snapshots.
- Price movement time-series data.
- Market volatility and volume.


2. RL Agent Layer

Purpose: Train a reinforcement learning agent to optimize hedging strategies in the simulated environment.

RL Model:
    Algorithm: Deep Q-Learning or Double DQN for stability.
    Input:
        Micro-level features: LOB data, price deltas, historical returns, volatility.
        Macro-level features: LLM insights (e.g., market sentiment, macroeconomic indicators).
    Output: Hedging decisions (e.g., delta adjustment, position size).
        Reward Function: Combines:
        Hedging Accuracy: Penalty for deviations from delta/gamma neutrality.
        Profitability: Reward for maximizing PnL.
        Risk Management: Penalty for excessive transaction costs or slippage.

Neural Network Structure:
    Input Layer: Concatenation of micro and macro-level features.
    Hidden Layers: Multiple dense layers with ReLU activation.
    Output Layer: Q-values for each possible action (e.g., buy, sell, hold).


3. LLM Augmentation 

Purpose: Enhance the RL agent with high-level market insights.

LLM Tasks:
    Process historical market data, news headlines, and macroeconomic indicators.
    Extract features such as:
        Volatility regimes (e.g., high vs. low volatility).
        Sentiment analysis from textual data (e.g., news articles, earnings reports).
        Predictions for short-term trends based on historical patterns.
Feature Integration:
Convert LLM outputs into quantitative features.
Add these features as additional inputs to the RL agent's state representation.

4. Evaluation and Benchmarking Layer

Purpose: Measure the system's performance and compare it with benchmarks.

Key Metrics:
    Hedging Error: Accuracy of delta and gamma hedging.
    Profitability: Net PnL after transaction costs.
    Market Impact: Efficiency in managing slippage and transaction costs.
    Robustness: Performance across varying market conditions (e.g., high volatility vs. low volatility).
Benchmarks:
    Baseline RL agent (without LLM augmentation).
    Classical methods for options hedging (e.g., Black-Scholes, Monte Carlo simulations).
    State-of-the-art models referenced in Chopra et al. (2024).

        Collect macro-level features from LLM insights.
    Action Selection: Use the RL policy (e.g., ε-greedy exploration) to decide hedging actions.
    Reward Calculation: Compute rewards based on hedging accuracy, profitability, and transaction costs.
    Policy Update: Train the neural network using Q-learning updates.

3. LLM Feature Generation
    Input Data: Provide the LLM with historical market data, news headlines, and other contextual information.
    Output Features:
        Predictive trends (e.g., price direction, volatility).
        Sentiment scores (e.g., positive/negative market sentiment).
    Feature Integration: Normalize LLM outputs and feed them into the RL agent's input pipeline.

4. Testing and Evaluation
    Test Scenarios: Run the system in various simulated market conditions (e.g., bull, bear, and volatile markets).
    Performance Comparison: Compare the LLM-augmented RL model with baseline models and state-of-the-art benchmarks.
    Iterative Improvement: Refine the architecture based on performance gaps.
